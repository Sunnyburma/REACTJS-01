React
*****
    ReactJS is the javaScript library

    React library given by facebook

    ReactJS, used to develop web applications

    ReactJS current version is "18.x"

    we will develop web applications in two ways.

    1)JSX

    2)TSX

    JSX stands for JavaScript and XML

    TSX stands for TypeScript and XML

    JavaScript is the "Scripting Language"

    TypeScript is the "Programmmig Language" 

    JavaScript wont follows the "OOPs"

    TypeScript is follows the "OOPs"

    In General, Browsers can,t understand the XML.

    so, we should convert XML to Equalent JavaScript.
    
    Babel is the inbuild tool of ReactJS, used to convert XML to Equalent javaScript

    React Internally follows the virtal DOM.

    Because of virtual DOM React application are faster  compared to Angular applications

    Angular application follows Real DOM   

    Software Installation
    *********************

    1) Download and install NodeJS
        NodeJS internally containes following tools
            1) node
            2) npm
            3) npx
        node tools, used to execute the JavaScript
        npm stands for "node packaging manager"
        npm helps to install the ReactJS
        npx stands for "node packaging runner"
        npx creates the environment to build "react applications"

    2)  install yarn tools
        yarn tool given facebook
        yarn tool, used to download the "libraries" / "modules"
        yarn tool Installation is "command based" Installation 

        > npm install --location=global yarn   

     3) install create-react-app

        create-react-app is the tool
        create-react-app tool used to create the react applications
        create-react-app tool Installation is command based Installation

        > npm install --location=global create-react-app  

    4) Download and install Visual Studio Code

    step to create react application
    ********************************

    > npx create-react-app first-app    
    > cd first-app
    > yarn start / npm start

    The Default Port No of react application is 3000

    Directory structure of React Application 
    *****************************************
    node_modules
        node_modules containes libraries
        node_modules helps to create and execute the react applications

    pubilc/index.html
        react starts the execution from "index"
        "index.html" file is the main template in react application
        "index.html" containes "div" whose id is "root"

    src 
        This folder used to deploy the components
        App.js file is the Default component
        App.css file is the Style Sheet for App Component
        App.test.js is the unit test case file App Component

    src/index.css
        used to defined the global styles
        These styles applicable to app components

    src/index.js
        index.js file, used to register the components
        index.js file will link/handover our component to main template(index.html)

    Package.json
        Package.json file containes
        libraries information

    Components
    ***********
        Reuseable Portion of Complex UI is called Component
        We can create More Than one components
        We can provide communication Between components
        Components are Reuseable
        We can include one Component to other Component
        we can create Components in two ways
        1)Functional Level components (Stateless Components)
        2)class Level Components (Statefull Components)
        


    Single Page Application 
    ***********************
    Loading one component to another component without refreshing
    is called as Single Page Application .    

    navigation of one component to another component is Single Page 
    Application CAlled as "Routing".

    we will implement Single Page Application with following library

    react-router-dom@6


    axios library, used to make rest api calls
    ex: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD......
    To install axios in linux : yarn add axios  
    To install axios in windows : npm install axios

    200 code means : positive response;

    State Management
    *****************************************
    To reduce the complexity of communication between components, we have 
    state Management

    we will implement state Management in two ways.

    1)context API

        createContext()

        useContex()

    2)Redux

    Integration of Redux to React Application
    **************************************************
    1) create the react application

            > npx create-react-app redux-ex3

    2) switch to redux-ex3
    
            > cd redux-ex3

    3) download the node modules

            > redux

            > react-redux

            redux library used to create redux architecture

            react-redux used to integrate redux architecture to react application 

            yarn add redux react-redux  or npm install redux and npm install react-redux

    4) create the reducer
    ***************************************************
    reducer-ex3
            src
                reducer
                    reducer.js

    *******************************************************

    5) deploy reducer to "store" and make "store" availability to component

        index.js

    6) perform subscription and dispatch operations in App Component    



    CRUD Appliction (MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, Redux Redux-Thunk, React)
    ***********************************************************************************
    MongoDB is NoSQL Database.

    MongoDB is light weight Database.

    MongoDB is Supports JSON.

    MongoDB is by Default running on port No. 27017.

    ****************************************************************************
                SQL                                   NoSQL
    ******************************************************************************

    Ex.
        oracle                                      MongoDB
        MySQL
        SQLserver

        Database                                    Database   

        table                                       collections

        records                                     Documents

        Primary key                                 _id
        **********************************************************************************

    MongoDB Atlas provides the cloud environment


    Database details
    ******************

    Database name : mern_stack

    collection name : products

    user_name : admin

    password : admin

    url : mongodb+srv://admin:admin@sambait.s9lniuw.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=SambaIT




    NodeJS
    *****************

    NodeJS backend technology

    NodeJS used to connect to Databases

    we will develop NodeJS Appliction with the help of javaScript

    NodeJS supports modules / libraries


    1) Express

        express module use to develop rest api's

    Ex.
        GET
        POST
        PUT
        DELETE
        ------
        ------
        ------

    2) MongoDB

        mongodb module used to develop the mongodb database

    3) Cors

        Cors module used enable the "Cors" policy
        

    we will download above modules with the help of either "npm" or "yarn"

    1) create the server directory

    2) switch the server directory 
        >cd server

    3) download the node node_modules

        =>express

        =>mongodb

        =>cors

        > yarn add express mongodb cors           //for linux os, this command

        > npm install express mongodb cors       //for windows os, this command

    4) develop the rest api's

        server.js

    

    Thunk Application
    *********************************************************

    1) create react application 

        > npx create-react-app crud-app

    2)switch to react application

        > cd crud-app

    3)download node modules

        => redux             //npm install redux

        => react-redux       //npm install react-redux

        => redux-Thunk       //npm install redux-thunk

        => axios             //npm install axios                   axios is use to connect to server

        > npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk axios

    import axios
    axios used to make rest api calls
    arrow function behaves like action 
    inner arrow function used to connect to reducer
    dispatch object used to carry the data from action to reducer
    axios internally returns promises
    async and await keywords are used to consume promises
